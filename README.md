### vim-listtools

A set of tools to get, modify, insert, and join lists of strings.

---

Listtools provides a set of commands, mappings and functions to handle lists
of strings quickly and easily.

For example it makes this kind of thing easy:

1. Get a list of matches from a given vim pattern inside a range of line

2. Insert the found elements elsewhere in a buffer, in a different custom
   format (for example with each element surrounded with quotes, and
   separated by commas).

You can also perform some set operations on the lists, like union, intersection, extend, filtering, list mapping...
